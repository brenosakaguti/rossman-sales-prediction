# Rossmann Sales Prediction
## Introduction
Rossmann is a drug store chain in Europe operating thousands of stores throughout the continent. This project is based on a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/overview) hosted on Kaggle that involved predicting sales figures six weeks in advance based on past performance. The competition has since ended, but the data will be used in the project as practice.
## The Project
The project is composed of two jupyter notebook files, `rossmann_sales_prediction.ipynb` which contains the initial exploratory analysis and visualization of the data, and `rossmann_models.ipynb`, where we prepared the data for the machine learning models, trained them and used it to predict sales. Finally, the predicted data was sent back to Kaggle to be scored.
